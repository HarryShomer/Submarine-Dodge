# Submarine Dodge

Submarine Dodge is a game in which you are the captain of a submarine that is being chased. Your goal is to maneuver your submarine so you don't get hit by any missiles while ensuring you don't crash into any sea creatures. The objective is to see how long you can go until you run out of lives. 

## Prerequisites 

The project was built solely with Java. This project uses nothing fancy so any reasonable version of Java should be fine. Java can be installed from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). 

In order to easily build the project you will need ant (I strongly recommend this). That can be installed from [here] (https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html). For Mac it can be installed through Homebrew.

## Running

To run the game you first need to build it. Head over to the home directory of the project (the one with the build.xml file in it) on your terminal and run:

```
ant 
``` 

Then to launch the game type:

``` 
ant run
``` 

## Gameplay

There is not much to say. Just don't get hit by anything. You have five lives so after five collisions with either missiles or sea creatures you lose. The only way to maneuver your submarine is up and down using the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard.
